# Getting Started 

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`

If you just create a file named `.env` in the directory and set the values like the following, the app will just work:
REACT_APP_NEWS_API_KEY=9872b636607745b49fb4cd277e8b7604
###### Note: If you have depency problems, put that in your `.env` file: SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true

Now, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open (http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


For see all the application working, you have to run the both at the same time (api and client)
